 A collaboration with Josh Becker developed for Hack Princeton 2018.
 uPdo is a react-based web frontend for a port of the puredata visual
 audio programming language called WebPd.  It extends webpd with the 
 ability to load, edit, export, and play Pd patches in the browser.
 It was made in 24 hours, so it's a little buggy.
