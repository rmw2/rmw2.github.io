  An open source library developed while working on the
  uport project at Consensys.  This is effectively a javascript
  implementation of the EIP712 ethereum type system, allowing
  runtime type safety when manipulating EIP712/solidity types,
  and providing convenience functions for hashing, signing, and
  generating JSON RPCs for the `eth_signTypedData` endpoint.
