  An undergraduate independent work project advised by Bob Dondero. Assemblance is
  a webapp which compiles simple C programs, and illustrates the mapping between
  the source and compiled (x86-64, AT&T syntax) assembly and provides helpful explanations 
  of the various mnemonics used, by parsing the gcc-generated DWARF debugging information.
