# hello `$friend`,

my name is rob whitaker, though you may know me by one of many nicknames and diminutives, which i tell myself are bestowed affectionately. some of these include:

![it me]({{ "/assets/img/me.png" | absolute_url }}){: .image .small .right }

 - robiño &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*("raw bean yo")*
 - robinho &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*("ho bean you")*
 - robalogna &nbsp;*("raw baloney")*
 - robster &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(rhymes with "lobster" or "mobster")*
 - bert &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(companion of Ernie)*
 - berto     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*("bear toe")*
 - bear &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(no toes)*
 - jung rob  &nbsp;&nbsp;*(à la "Carl Jung")*
 - robwhit   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*("rob whit")*
 - whittyrob &nbsp;*(i think i'm funny)*
 - robbie    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(limited time offer, expired in 2010)*
 - [spaghet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wLIhRXwFfI) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(don't toucha)*

however, i do **not** respond to the following names:
 - mr. whitaker *(just call me teach)*
 - robert &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(what, am i in trouble?)*
 - robby &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(i can hear the difference, don't try me)*
 - bob &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*('twas my grandfather's name)*
 - bobby &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(i have a friend named bobby; he can have this one)*

i am a software engineer by trade, and currently work on *"cluster bootstrapping"* and *"disaster recovery"* as an sre at google, though i promise i'm fun at parties. i currently live in san francisco, ca.

i love a lot of things, especially **food**, **art**, **music**, and **existing**, and i like to do all of them as often as possible. i do not consider myself particularly good at any of them.  

i like to spend unhealthy amounts of my free time finding new tunes and telling my friends about them.  sometimes i also make my own tunes, but i rarely tell my friends about them.  you can find the kind of stuff i like on [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/rwhitaker2), and stuff i mix on [mixcloud](https://mixcloud.com/rob-whitaker-2).  one day i might show you the stuff i make. today is not that day.

i often post pictures of the food i make on [instagram](https://instagram.com/whittyrob).



finally, i'm a proud alumnus, former officer, and member of the board of governors of [terrace f. club](https://princetonterraceclub.org/).  food is love.
